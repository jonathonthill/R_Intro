  Output: We are almost finished talking about R basics. However, I want to 
    quickly talk about packages in R.

  Output: Packages are groups of functions that can be distributed and loaded by 
    other users. You have already used at least one package, because you are using 
    swirl. When you loaded swirl, you were loading all of the code necessary for 
    these lessons. Using packages can be a huge time saver. Imagine if you had to 
    code everything from scratch every time!

  Output: There are two steps to using a package. The first is to download and 
    install the code. The second is to load the code for use.

    Installing packages in R is very simple, but the process will depend on 
    where the package comes from. There are two major repositories of R packages 
    for biologists. The first is the main R repository CRAN. To install a CRAN 
    package. You simply have to type install.packages() and provide a vector of 
    one or more packages as an argument to the function. Let's try it out. To continue our lesson, 
    we need two packages: 'devtools' and 'BiocManager'. Both are installed from 
    the CRAN database. Go ahead and install them now. Note: Capitilization matters 
    with package names.
  CorrectAnswer: install.packages(c("devtools", "BiocManager"))
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100)')
  Hint: Type c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10, 100) to see how R handles adding two vectors,
    when the shorter vector's length does not divide evenly into the longer vector's
    length. Don't worry about assigning the result to a variable.
